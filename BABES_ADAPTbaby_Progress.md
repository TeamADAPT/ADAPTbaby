# BABES ADAPTbaby Progress

## Latest Updates (As of [Current Date])

### Enhanced Admin Dashboard
- Added more detailed analytics and visualizations to the admin dashboard:
  - Implemented a model usage chart showing the number of times each model has been used
  - Created an average response time chart for each model
  - Added a user activity over time chart to track overall system usage

### Revised Next Steps
- Updated the priority of next steps based on recent progress

## Previous Updates

### User Authentication and Admin Interface
- Implemented user registration, login, and logout functionality
- Created an admin interface for managing users and model usage
- Added user roles (admin and regular user)

### Model Testing Improvements
- Enhanced the model testing interface to support multiple AI models simultaneously
- Implemented response time tracking for each model
- Added a bar chart to visualize response times

### Admin Dashboard
- Created a basic admin dashboard for viewing model usage statistics
- Implemented user management features in the admin interface

### Error Handling and Logging

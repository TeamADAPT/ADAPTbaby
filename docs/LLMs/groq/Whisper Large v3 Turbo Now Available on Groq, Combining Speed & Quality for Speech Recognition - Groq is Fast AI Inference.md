We’re excited to announce that Whisper Large v3 Turbo (whisper-large-v3-turbo) is now available to the developer community on [GroqCloud™ Developer Console](https://console.groq.com/?_gl=1*mntjiz*_gcl_au*MTI4MjM3MjI0NS4xNzI5MDExMjk4*_ga*MjAwMDEwMzM1MC4xNzI5MDEwNzkw*_ga_4TD0X2GEZG*MTcyOTAxMTI5OC4xLjEuMTcyOTAxMTI5OC42MC4wLjA.). This pruned and fine-tuned version of OpenAI’s Whisper model complements the existing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, Whisper Large V3 and Distil-Whisper, and is designed to provide faster and less expensive multilingual speech recognition while maintaining comparable accuracy (vs Whisper Large v3).

Whisper Large v3 Turbo provides an incredible balance of the benefits of Whisper Large v3 and Distil-Whisper in terms of speed, quality, and capabilities. At **216x real-time speed factor** it is faster than Whisper Large v3 while maintaining multilingual capabilities and has a ~1% lower Word Error Rate (WER) than Distil-Whisper. 

The addition of Whisper Large v3 Turbo to GroqCloud expands the range of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) options available to developers, providing a faster and more efficient alternative to the original Whisper Large v3 model.

This new model is ideal for applications that require rapid multilingual speech recognition, such as:

-   **Real-time customer service chatbots** that need to quickly transcribe customer inquiries and respond with personalized solutions
-   **Automated speech-to-text systems** for industries like finance and education, where fast and accurate transcription is critical
-   **Voice-controlled interfaces** for smart homes, cars, and other devices, where rapid speech recognition is essential
-   **Audio and video recording transcriptions** – such as interviews, lectures, podcasts, and TV shows – for media professionals, enabling them to focus on editing, analysis, and other tasks
-   **Transcription and summarization** (in conjunction with LLMs) that can used on meeting recordings to create a list of action items and decisions or simplify the process of insurance claims and improve service by transcribing recordings of interviews, phone calls, and other interactions with customers
